\section{State Of The Art Analysis}\label{sec:state-of-the-art-analysis}
This section will discuss the state of the art of technologies already used in amusement parks around the world.
It will also focus on those used, or that have been used in the past, in the Mirabilandia park in Italy.
The main purpose is to understand what would be the best ``smart'' and innovative technological options to use in Mirabilandia nowadays considering the Micro City context.
As seen in the documents ``Micro City - Domain Analysis'' and ``Micro City - Case Study Analysis'', an Amusement Park as a Micro City has the following necessities:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Queue management: the park may want to offer its visitors the possibility of reducing the waiting time to access an attraction, event or a food service
    \item Personalization of the experience: recommendation systems may be used by the park to suggest attractions, restaurants, events, etc.
    based on the visitors' interests
    \item Proximity/localization suggestions: visitors may receive on their wearable device some notifications concerning marketing, offers or the queue with fewer wait-time based on their position within the park
\end{itemize}

There are many solutions adopted by some amusement parks to support the previous points.
For instance, the avoiding long lines problem is faced with virtual queueing\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_queue}} systems
and for recommendation and proximity marketing\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximity_marketing}} there are many different solutions.

The following sections are intended to provide an overview of companies' products and technologies already used in amusement parks around the world,
as well as Mirabilandia's current offer in terms of smart services.

\subsection{Accesso Technology Group}\label{subsec:accesso-technology-group}
Accesso Technology Group\footnote{\url{https://www.accesso.com/}} (formerly Lo-Q) is an English company that provides different solutions
mostly to amusement parks like the ``Six Flags'' corporation in the US and ``LEGOLAND Windsor Resort'' in the UK but also to airports,
ski facilities, events and places that need social distancing management and so on.
Their two main solutions of interest for a Micro City context are a virtual queueing system and the personalization of
the \textit{visitors}' experience by sending them tailored contents, offers and recommendations.
Furthermore, along with their virtual queueing products they integrate a location-based messaging system.

\subsubsection{Lo-Queue Virtual Queueing Products}
Their patented~\cite{q-management-system-patent} \cite{q-system-patent}
virtual queueing technology allows a virtual queue to dynamically adjusts to many different unpredictable real-time variables such
as guest flow, bad weather, ride down time, etc.
automatically revising wait times and communicating real-time updates to \textit{visitors}.
The mechanism, simply lets the visitors choose a ride and, when their turn comes, are notified to head to the attraction.

Their two current products for virtual queueing are \textit{Qsmart} and \textit{Prism}\footnote{\url{https://www.accesso.com/solutions/virtual-queuing/prism}}.
The former allows people to access the virtual queueing services directly from their smartphones, whereas the latter is a ``smartwatch-like''
wearable.

\subsubsection*{Prism}
Prism is a standalone device, with no need for kiosks or charging stations to support its use.
Moreover, it is waterproof, hypoallergenic and durable~\cite{prism-desc}.
As can be observed in Figure~\ref{fig:prism}, Prism provides the following functionalities:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Virtual queueing: \textit{visitors} can manage their reservation in line and monitor the line status
    \item Payments: \textit{visitors} can make payments via secure NFC technology
    \item Messaging: \textit{visitors} can receive push notifications for proximity-based marketing (i.e.\ trigger nearby events based on people location, Figure~\ref{fig:prism-icecream}), operational updates, or the status of pending virtual queue positions
    \item Photography: Prism allows automated tagging of ride and park photographs
    \item Access: \textit{visitors} can easily access park turnstiles, guest lockers, resort hotel rooms, etc.
    \item Intelligence: Prism collects real-time information about the users' behaviour during the visit for marketing and park operations purposes
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{img/prism-icecream}
    \caption{Example of a push notification based on the visitor proximity to an ice cream shop}
    \label{fig:prism-icecream}
\end{figure}

In addition to their patented virtual queueing technologies, Prism works on a \textbf{proprietary network} and uses three ways to communicate:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Bluetooth Low Energy:} allows \textit{visitors} to receive real-time messages based on their location, and the park gains valuable insights about visitors' flow throughout the park
    \item \textbf{Near Field Communication (NFC):} used for access, payments, rentals, etc.
    \item \textbf{Long Range Sub-GHz Two-Way Radio:} allows \textit{visitors} to reserve and modify queueing reservations from where they are without having to use their smartphone
\end{itemize}

The wearable is made with waterproof materials and carries a vibrator motor for haptic feedback to interact with the user and send alerts.
Moreover, its battery supports over 200 days of usage.
Technical specifications~\cite{prism-manual} are listed in Tables~\ref{tab:ci-tec-spec},~\ref{tab:pr-tec-spec},~\ref{tab:c-tec-spec}.

\subsubsection*{QSmart}
On the other hand, QSmart is a ready-to-use platform and utilizes the visitor's smartphone hardware, is cloud based
and operates via Wi-Fi.

In addition to the features already listed for Prism, Qsmart gives the possibility to easily make rides and
show ticket purchases -- with its mobile payments system which is
PCI\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard}} compliant --,
allows choosing among a different set of ride packages with different perks depending on the price, validating the
ride by a ride attendant -- who scans a QR code on the visitor's smartphone -- and it can be integrated with other Accesso's products like, for instance, an online ticketing system.

    \label{fig:prismart}
\end{figure}
\footnotetext{\url{https://www.accesso.com/solutions/virtual-queuing}}

Both Prism and QSmart interact with the Virtual Queue Management System, where customers can consult
analytics and performance data as well as centralised data on park attendace.
It is also possible to check ride usage, \textit{visitors} activity, ride downtime and transactional data per user and how log they waited for each ride.
Finally it is possible to control in real-time the virtual queueing solution.

\subsubsection{The Experience Engine (TE2) Recommendation system}
The Experience Engine\footnote{\url{https://www.accesso.com/solutions/guest-experience}} is a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) technology
which allows the park to connect with \textit{visitors} in real-time and provides them with relevant offers, messages and recommendations.
It is integrated with Accesso's Virtual Queueing Products and could work as a location-based targeted system~\cite{accesso-location-based-exp} helping alleviate
long lines by driving traffic to other less utilized outlets, or by incentivizing guests to dine before or after the rush
hours with special offers.
The platform communicates with Bluetooth Beacons\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_low_energy_beacon}} and,
whenever a visitorâ€™s device receives a beacon signal, the device notifies the TE2 platform of the proximity to a beacon.
TE2 then determines the visitor's real interest in a scheduled experience.
If so, the visitor will receive a notification.
Thanks to this platform, Accesso's clients can create custom itineraries for every park's visitor.
In Figure~\ref{fig:te2ex} is synthesized the TE2 functioning.

\subsection{Disney Parks, Experiences and Products}\label{subsec:disney-parks-experiences-and-products}
Disney Parks, Experiences and Products, Inc., is one of The Walt Disney Company's business.
In its parks ``Walt Disney World'', Florida and ``Disneyland Resort'', California offers their \textit{visitors} solutions
for virtual queuing and a recommendation.
In fact, guests can use the ``My Disney Experience'' app and enjoy the ``Disney Genie'', ``Disney Genie+'' and ``Lighting Lane''\footnote{\url{https://www.disneyworld.eu/genie/information/}} services.
The former is free of charge whether ``Genie+'' and ``Lighting Lane'' have additional costs.
The perks in Figure\ref{fig:dgenie} are the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Tailored recommendations: \textit{visitors} can receive attraction and dining recommendations based on what is the preferred visiting plan they previously told
    to the service
    \item Virtual assistant: provides a virtual assistant to ask questions about the park
    \item Time-based suggestions: it displays a good time to go to a suggested experience and an idea of the forecasted wait for attractions, entertainment and dining
    \item Booking \textit{activities}: order food, make dining reservations, check into a restaurant, request to join an available virtual queue or book arrival times in a reserved entrance for
    some activities.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

\subsection{Mirabilandia Solutions}\label{subsec:mirabilandia-solutions}
In 2009, Mirabilandia used to sell to its \textit{visitors} the Accesso's \textit{Qbot} device -- a previous version of Prism -- named ``V-Pass''\cite{v-pass-mira}, but is no
longer available to this days.
Instead, they now provide the ``Flash Pass''\footnote{\url{https://www.mirabilandia.it/en/organizza-la-tua-visita/attivita/flash-pass}},
a paper card or bracelet that gives you priority access to the attractions by a reserved entrance but has no virtual queueing system integration.

Mirabilandia provides an app\footnote{\url{https://www.mirabilandia.it/en/prima-del-tuo-arrivo/la-nostra-app}} that lets the \textit{visitors} to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item buy tickets
    \item an interactive map
    \item itineraries
    \item show times
    \item selecting a plan by attraction's category (``extreme'', ``for families'', ``water'', etc.) Figure\ref{fig:miraApp}
\end{itemize}

Lastly, Mirabilandia offers a virtual queueing service Qoda\footnote{\url{https://get.qoda.app/}} for a very limited set of refreshment points
and stores.
It works by scanning a QR code one can find at the point of interest and it will immediately tell the waiting number on
the person's mobile phone, as well as the estimated time for their turn.
