\section{Mirabilandia as a micro-city}\label{sec:mira-microcity}

As mentioned in the previous section, Mirabilandia does not offer a recommendation or virtual queuing services.
In this section, we describe a possible implementation of the "smart micro-city" concept applied to the context of amusement parks, specifically that
of Mirabilandia.

Following the analysis of the ``as-is'' system and the goals set to adapt the smart micro-city concept on Mirabilandia,
figure~\ref{fig:architecture-overview} shows the component diagram modeling the entities involved and the main relationships between them.

The main components of the system are the following:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Map Manager}: is responsible for tracking the guest within the park and providing information about the current position
	\item \textit{Virtual Queueing System}: is responsible for managing the virtual queue for each attraction
	\item \textit{Recommender}: is responsible for providing recommendations to the guests based on their preferences and position within the park
	\item \textit{Planner}: is responsible for planning the itinerary of the guests based on their preferences and crowding of rides
\end{itemize}

From the diagram emerge that \textit{Map Manager} and \textit{Virtual Queueing System} are the main components of the system since they are the ones
that provide information to the other components. The \textit{Map Manager} provides information about the current position of the guests
to the \textit{Recommender} which uses this information to provide recommendations to the guests. Moreover, gives information also to the
\textit{Planner} to avoid crowd situations and maintain a uniform distribution of guests in the park. The \textit{Virtual Queueing System} is used by
the \textit{Planner} to plan the itinerary of the guests and adapt it to reduce the waiting time and improve the quality of the visit within the park
and by the \textit{Recommender} to fetch information about the current waiting time of the attractions and opportunistically advise the attraction.

\subsection{Map Manager}

The location of guests within the amusement park is critical for several reasons: guest location information is used to make recommendations and to determine the best plan for each guest. So, good tracking is crucial for the good working of the overall system.
