\subsection{Wi-Fi as outdoor localization system}

Il Wi-Fi non e' di certo la prima tecnologia a cui si pensa quando e' richiesto di localizzare persone o dispositivi
in un contesto outdoor. Il GPS (Global Positioning System) e' la tecnologia piu' diffusa e famosa per raggiungere questo
tipo di obiettivo. Tuttavia, quest'ultima tecnologia presenta diverse limitazioni: la precisione e' nell'ordine di qualche
decina di metri, l'impatto energetico nell'utilizzo su dispositivi mobile e' molto elevato e in zone ad alta densit√† 
abitativa, il GPS fatica a fornire una misura accurata della posizione.

Over the past decades, localization service has been applied to a variety of different applications.
So far, the global position system (GPS) has been the dominant technology to enable outdoor localization.
However, since GPS localization requires the line of sight to four or more satellites, it does not work well in certain urban regions,
such as a downtown canyon surrounded by skyscrapers.
Another problem with GPS is its high power consumption, which is a serious challenge to battery-based mobile devices.
To tackle the problems with GPS, many researchers have proposed a series of alternative localization schemes, including cellular-based systems \cite{ibrahim2010cellsense},
infrared-based systems, ultrasonic-based systems, and radio frequency (RF)-based systems~\cite{bahl2000radar, youssef2002probabilistic}.

Many researchers have proposed a variety of different schemes for outdoor localization based on mobile
devices. These schemes can be divided into two groups: range-based and range-free methods.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Range-based}: range-based methods are mainly based on relative distance, which can be obtained through measuring methods like time-of-arrival (ToA),
    time difference of arrival (TDoA), or propagation model generated from RSSI value.
    \item \textbf{Range-free}: one of the most widely used range-free method is fingerprint localization method. This method can be categorized into three types: visual fingerprint-based localization, motion fingerprint-based systems, and
    signal fingerprint-based methods. In our context the last one is the most promising.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Signal fingerprint-based localization}
Signal fingerprint-based localization is widely used in places where a large number of WiFi infrastructures are deployed. This methods commonly consist of offline training phase
and online fingerprint matching phase. The goal of the first phase is to form a fingerprint database which stores the correlation between \textit{Received Signal Strength} (RSS) from
various \textit{Access Points}(APs) and fix locations. The device's location is determined at the matching stage. In this process we use matching algorithm to search the fingerprint
in the database which has the minimum difference with the device need to be located and the associated label is our estimated location.

In terms of effect, signal fingerprint-based localization has the ability to get fine-grained results. However, it is impractical to transfer this method directly from the indoor environment to the
outdoor environment, because there are many problems such as complicated training work and complex outdoor environment.

A new approach in signal fingerprint-based localization is proposed in~\cite{du2018hybrid}. In the article they propose the following technique to stimate the position 
of a device: we use $f = {r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_n}$ to indicate a \textit{fingerprint} where $r_i$ represents the RSS value of captured AP and $n$ the number of APs in the fingerprint.
We calculate the dissimilarity between two fingerprints based on RSS difference. Denote with $\sigma_i = | r_i - r^{'}_{i}|$ the difference of fingerprints $f^{'}$ and $f$ at each $A_i$ where
$A_i \in A$ where $A$ is the fingerprint's APs set. Due to the fact that two fingerprints may contain different set of APs, so it may appear that AP $A_i$ appears in $f$ but
does not appear in $f^{'}$. For this situation, we assume the signal strength is weak and let the missing value equal to $-100$. The dissimilarity between $f$ and $f^{'}$ can be shown as:

\begin{equation}
    \eta(f, f^{'}) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=0}^{p} \sigma_i^{2}}
\end{equation}

where $p = | A \cup A^{'} |$

We found the sample with minimum dissimilarity through compare all samples stored in the fingerprint database $F$ with the query fingerprint $f$.

\begin{equation}
    f^{*} = \arg \max_{f_i \in F} \ \eta(f, f_i)
\end{equation}

$L(f^{*})$ is the corresponding location of $f^{*}$ which represent the estimated place.
