# Micro City: Domain Analysis

The following define the Micro City concept:

- **Guests** are endowed with a _wearable_ device (e.g. smartphone, smartwatch, etc.)
- There are well defined **physical bounds**
- Presents a well-defined operation **periods**
- Heterogeneous **activities** physically situated and distributed
- **Guests** are _highly_ interested in the **activities**
- **Guests** may form **queues** to access the **activities**
- **Activities** may be proactive recommend to **guests** based on their position and interests
- **Guests** accepting **recommendations** may receive a **reward**
- **Micro City** presents a map to locate and oriente the **guests**

# Case Study: Amusement Park

In the context of the _Amusement Park_, the following concepts are defined:

- **Visitor:** a person attending the amusement park
- **Attraction:** rides, roller coasters, restaurants and shops
- **Show:** a show taking place in a specific moment and location
- **Recommendation:** a suggestion to visit an attraction or a show in exchange for a reward
- **Reward:** the recompense received by the visitor for accepting a recommendation

# Mirabilandia today

- Limited technological support to **visitors**
  - Totem with information about the park
  - Mobile application
- No technological support about **queue managements**
- No system to improve the visitor experience, based on their interests

# State of the art

The state of the art analysis was lead by the following requirements:

- Reducing the waiting time in queues
- Personalization of the visitor experience
- Situated and proximity-based suggestions

# Mirabilandia as a Micro City

---
# Overview

We will illustrate an architecture with all the components needed to satisfy the characteristics
of an amusement park as a Micro City: offer a tailored and dynamic experience based on visitorsâ€™
preferences and a situated recommendation system with a rewards system.

The architecture structure is composed of the following elements:

- A tracking system of visitors' position within the park
- A recommendation and reward system
- A system to manage queues in a smart way
- A manager for visitors' information
- A service to generate custom plans for each visitors for a day in the park.

# Suitable Technologies

We analyzed the literature about the technologies that could be used implement of the previous architecture's components.

The following technologies were taken into account to evaluate their feasibility in a realistic scenario for implementing
**visitors tracking** and **situated recommendation**:

- Wi-Fi
- Bluetooth (Beacons)
- NFC
- Sub-GHz
- GPS

# Identified Technologies

## Planner Strategies

We want to focus on what goals an algorithm in charge of calculating the best plan should achieve based on various factors,
instead of providing a real algorithm to compute it.

- **Completed Rides Indicator (CRI):** indicates the number of rides completed within one hour
- **Wandering Time Indicator (WTI):** indicates the quantity of time spent in the queues within one hour
- **User Satisfaction Indicator (USI):** indicates the number of rides completed in an hour but which were expressed as preferences by the visitor.

These indicators could be used to determine a QoS for each plan and for the overall planning system.

## Situated Recommendation System

# Deployment Strategy

We deem that the best way to deploy the system is to use an hybrid approach, leveraging the cloud, the fog and the edge layers.

# Conclusions

- Identified, developed and partially formalized the Micro City concept
- Studied the literature about the technologies that could be used to implement the architecture
- Challenging to adapt the concept into a real-world case study
