# Micro City: Domain Analysis

The following define the Micro City concept:

- **Guests** are endowed with a _wearable_ device (e.g. smartphone, smartwatch, etc.)
- There are well defined **physical bounds**
- Presents a well-defined operation **periods**
- Heterogeneous **activities** physically situated and distributed
- **Guests** are _highly_ interested in the **activities**
- **Guests** may form **queues** to access the **activities**
- **Activities** may be proactive recommend to **guests** based on their position and interests
- **Guests** accepting **recommendations** may receive a **reward**
- **Micro City** presents a map to locate and oriente the **guests**

# Case Study: Amusement Park

In the context of the _Amusement Park_, the following concepts are defined:

- **Visitor:** a person attending the amusement park
- **Attraction:** rides, roller coasters, restaurants and shops
- **Show:** a show taking place in a specific moment and location
- **Recommendation:** a suggestion to visit an attraction or a show in exchange for a reward
- **Reward:** the recompense received by the visitor for accepting a recommendation

# Mirabilandia today

- Limited technological support to **visitors**
  - Totem with information about the park
  - Mobile application
- No technological support about **queue managements**
- No system to improve the visitor experience, based on their interests

# State of the art

The state of the art analysis was lead by the following requirements:

- Reducing the waiting time in queues
- Personalization of the visitor experience
- Situated and proximity-based suggestions

## Accesso technology group

**Accesso Technology Group** is a company that provides software and hardware solutions for the amusement park industry.
Their flagship products are:

- _Qsmart_ is a cloud-based platform that utilizes the guest' smartphone
- _Prism_ is a smartwatch-like device

Either of these products leverage the _Experience Engine_ (TE2) and a patented _Virtual Queuing Technology_.

# Mirabilandia as a Micro City

---

# Overview

We will illustrate an architecture with all the components needed to satisfy the characteristics
of an amusement park as a Micro City: offer a tailored and dynamic experience based on visitorsâ€™
preferences and a situated recommendation system with a rewards system.

The architecture structure is composed of the following elements:

- A **tracking system** of visitors' position within the park
- A **recommendation** and **reward system**
- A system to **manage queues** in a smart way
- A manager for visitors' information
- A service to generate **custom plans** for each visitors for a day in the park.

# Suitable Technologies

We analyzed the literature about the technologies that could be used implement of the previous architecture's components.

The following technologies were taken into account to evaluate their feasibility in a realistic scenario for implementing
**visitors tracking** and **situated recommendation**:

- Wi-Fi
- Bluetooth (Beacons)
- NFC
- Sub-GHz
- GPS

---

# Identified Technologies

---

## Planner Strategies

We want to focus on what goals an algorithm in charge of calculating the best plan should achieve based on various factors,
instead of providing a real algorithm to compute it.

- **Completed Rides Indicator (CRI):** indicates the number of rides completed within one hour
- **Wandering Time Indicator (WTI):** indicates the quantity of time spent in the queues within one hour
- **User Satisfaction Indicator (USI):** indicates the number of rides completed in an hour but which were expressed as preferences by the visitor.

These indicators could be used to determine a QoS for each plan and for the overall planning system.

---

## Localization System

The location via GPS could not be feasible because of **high power consumption** and **low accuracy**.

The localization technology should observe the following requirements:

- Power Efficient
- Low installations cost
- Best accuracy possible

---

## Fingerprint-base localization

The fingerprint-based localization is a technique that uses the signal strength of the received signal to determine the location of the device.

In order to determines the location of the device, the following steps are performed:

- Scan the environment collecting the signal strength of the received signal from each AP
- Compare the signal strength of the received signal with the signal strength of the APs in the database
- Determine the location of the device based on the APs with the highest similarity

---

## Fingerprint-based localization formalization

Denote with $\sigma_i = | r_i - r^{'}_{i}|$ the difference between two **RSSI**.

The dissimilarities between two fingerprints can be computed as:

$\eta(f, f^{'}) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=0}^{p} \sigma_i^{2}}$ where $p = | A \cup A^{'} |$

The location can be determined taken the fingerprint with the minimum dissimilarity:

$$f^{*} = \arg \min_{f_i \in F} \ \eta(f, f_i)$$

# Deployment Strategy

We deem that the best way to deploy the system is to use an hybrid approach, leveraging the cloud, the fog and the edge layers.

# Conclusions

- Identified, developed and partially formalized the Micro City concept
- Studied the literature about the technologies that could be used to implement the architecture
- Challenging to adapt the concept into a real-world case study
